// The readback slots' locking, on the CPU: shutting them down while a map is still in flight is
// what used to deadlock the game on exit, and it needs no GPU to reproduce.
//
// A buffer here stands in for a wgpu::Buffer. What matters is that the last handle to a buffer
// with a map pending on it runs that map's callback, on the thread that dropped it, as Dawn does
// when a buffer with a map in flight is destroyed - and that the callback takes the slots' lock,
// which is what the deadlock was. The callback is given the slot's key and nothing else, as the
// port gives it: a pending map that held its buffer would keep it alive past the slot, and a
// callback that arrived late could then touch whatever that slot holds now.
