// PrimedGun's modern control scheme: the headset controllers' snapshot
// (openxr_controller_snapshot.h) turned into Metroid Prime's GameCube pad on
// port 0, once per simulation tick, as PrimedGun's GCPadEmu did inside Dolphin
// (ApplyPrimedGunModernControls). Which mapping applies comes from the game's
// own state rather than memory probes: classic (menus, map, cutscenes, morph
// ball), gameplay (first person, unmorphed), or orbit lock.
//
// The beam wheel: holding the weapon hand's B freezes a panel 0.26 m ahead of
// the aim pose; the aim ray's hit on it (or the hand's travel, as a fallback)
// picks Power / Wave / Ice / Plasma by its dominant axis, and letting go pulses
// the C-stick that way for eight samples.
//
// The visor gesture (vr_visor_dpad.h): with the off-hand controller held next
// to the headset, its stick is the D-pad, which picks the visors.
//
// The snap turn (vr_snap_turn.h): with the setting on, a flick of the look
// stick turns Samus by the snap turn angle instead of turning her smoothly.
//
// Directional movement (vr_directional_move.h): with the setting on, the move
// stick walks and strafes toward where its controller points, and only the
// look stick turns.
