# Vendored runtime snapshots

Aurora and MusyX are tracked source snapshots, not submodules. A normal clone
contains the port patches; no private or unpublished dependency commits need to
be fetched. Keep their license files and source notices when updating them.

These commit IDs record provenance; they are not download requirements. Existing
developer checkouts retain their old submodule object databases under
`.git/modules/extern/` for historical comparisons.

Both snapshots carry MIT top-level license files. The earlier recompilation
project's DolRecomp/ModernGekko dependencies are separate and are not linked here.
Retain and review individual source notices as well as the top-level licenses.

Port-specific changes include deferred ARQ callbacks, FIFO draw-sync tokens,
bounded/validated ARAM copies, paused event-pump servicing, Windows runtime DLL
packaging, DVD base-file reads for overlays (`aurora_dvd_base_*`), PC audio stream buffers, pointer-width corrections, atomic muting,
and synchronous voice retirement before releasing group resources.

Aurora still obtains its transitive dependencies through its provider system;
versions are pinned in `aurora/cmake/AuroraDependencyVersions.cmake`. Native CI
builds the vendored source and does not run `git submodule update`.

`astcenc` is a snapshot of the encoder core only: `Source/astcenc.h` and
`Source/astcenc_*.{cpp,h}` (no CLI, tests, fuzzers, ThirdParty or images), with
`LICENSE.txt`. `extern/astcenc/CMakeLists.txt` is ours: a static library, SSE2 on
x86-64, NEON on arm64, plain C++ elsewhere, with no GCC-only flags on MSVC. It
writes the Remastered importer's ASTC textures (`platform/port_remastered_image.cpp`).

`adrenotools` is unmodified apart from the dropped `.git` folders. It is
built only for Android arm64 (`add_subdirectory(... EXCLUDE_FROM_ALL)` in the root
`CMakeLists.txt`): `platform/port_gpu_driver.cpp` uses it to load custom Vulkan
drivers such as Mesa Turnip, and Gradle packages its four hook libraries.
