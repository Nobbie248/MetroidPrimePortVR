 *
 * The OpenXR runtime creates Dawn's VkInstance and VkDevice (XR_KHR_vulkan_enable2, through
 * hooks Dawn calls while they are configured), the session is bound to Dawn's own device and
 * queue, and Aurora draws each eye straight into the acquired XrSwapchain image on Dawn's
 * queue: one pass per eye, and nothing to order across devices.
 *
 * The contract of the targets, the cancellation and the submitted callback is the one of
 * aurora/d3d12_interop.h, whose images live on Dawn's device too.
