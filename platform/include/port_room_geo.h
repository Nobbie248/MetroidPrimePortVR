// A room's static geometry as a list of models and where each stands. A mod supplies one
// per area as <MREA id>.roomgeo, with the models as ordinary CMDL files; the port draws
// them in place of the area's own world geometry.
//
// The file is little endian:
//   'MPRG', u32 version (1 to 10), u32 instances
//   instance: u32 CMDL id, f32 transform[12] (rows of model -> area)
//     version 2 adds: u8 layer, u8 active, u16 links,
//     version 3 (and 4) then: u32 platform, f32 platformStart[3],
//     then (2 to 4) per link: u32 sender, u8 state, u8 action, u16 delay (1/100 s; 0 in
//     files made before delays, which read as none)
// An instance whose CMDL does not exist is skipped.
//
// Version 2 is for scenery Remastered added as actors, which its scripts show and hide:
// such an instance is drawn only while the area's script layer `layer` is on (kEveryLayer:
// always), starts shown or hidden by `active`, and changes when the retail object with
// editor id `sender` sends `state` (an EScriptObjectState).
//
// Version 3 adds the actors a platform carries (its Play -> Activate connections, which
// retail's CScriptPlatform::BuildSlaveList takes as slaves): `platform` is the retail
// platform's editor id (0: none) and `platformStart` where it stands in the world when its
// area is made. Such an instance moves by what the platform has moved since, as a slave
// is dragged by the platform's translation alone.
//
// Version 3 may end with Remastered's own script objects that show and hide geometry, which
// retail has no object for (Script):
//   'SCRP', u32 nodes, u32 edges
//   node: u8 kind, u8 active, u16 0, u32 counter max, f32 centre[3], half[3], axes[9]
//   edge: u8 retail, u8 event, u8 action, u8 0, u32 from, u32 to
//   then u32 group per instance (kNoGroup: none)
//
// Version 4 may then end with the instances that glow in a colour of their own:
//   'GLOW', u32 count, per instance: u32 index, f32 glow[3]
// Remastered colours its door frames' lights with a ColorModulateMP1 in its "incandescence"
// mode, which stands its colour B (times its intensity) in for the strength of every
// material's emissive map. `glow` is that colour.
//
// Version 5 may then end with Remastered's animated scenery actors (the Intro Elevator's
// spinning rings, for one):
//   'ANIM', u32 count, per animated instance:
//     u32 index, f32 fps, u32 frames (2 or more), then per frame f32 rotation x, y, z, w
//     (unit quaternion) and f32 translation x, y, z
//
// Version 8 gives an animated instance a list of clips instead of one looping clip. Its entry
// is: u32 index, u8 flags (bit 0: start on show), u8 clips (1 or more), u16 0, then per clip
// f32 fps, u32 frames (2 or more), u8 loop (0 or 1), u8[3] 0, then the frames as above. A
// clip that does not loop holds its last pose, and the instance moves on to the next clip
// when it ends (or when a kGroupNextClip edge says so). Entries of versions 5 to 7 are one
// looping clip that starts at the area's load.
//
// Version 6 may then end with the room's skies:
//   'SKY ', u32 count, per sky: u32 index, and from version 7 f32 radiance r, g, b
// The radiance is Remastered's Skybox colour times its intensity, which takes the place of
// the sky materials' diffuse colour (DIFC): the base map times it is the light the sky
// gives, in Remastered's HDR units; 0 (version 6) for not known. A sky instance is not
// drawn with the room: the world's sky is drawn as it, centred on the camera, turned and scaled by its transform (whose translation is left out). Its layer,
// `active`, links and group show and hide it as they do any instance's.
//
// Version 9 may then end with the retail objects the instances stand in for:
//   'HIDE', u32 count (1 or more), per object: u32 editor id (its low 26 bits, as
//   TEditorId::Value), u32 instance
// Such an object is not drawn while the room geometry stands in for its area and that
// instance is shown (Hides): the Frigate hangar's floating debris, which Remastered draws as
// one animated actor, or Omega's tank while Remastered's own explosion plays.
//
// Version 10 may then end with the instances' lookups into the room's baked lightmap (the
// area's .roomenv holds the lightmap itself):
//   'LMAP', u32 count (the instances'), per instance: f32 offU, offV, scale
// A model's atlas UV is (offU + u * scale, offV + v * scale) for its UV0 (u, v), as Remastered
// takes it from the instance's vec4(offU, offV, scale, 0). Scale 0: the instance has none.
// The section is left out when no instance has a lookup.
