// Writes a Remastered particle effect (a parsed GENP, port_remastered_effect.h)
// as retail PART: the big-endian GPSM stream CParticleDataFactory reads (and
// its swoosh and electric children as SWHC and ELSC).
//
// The conversion is driven by retail's own reader: each property retail knows
// is read as the type retail reads it as (int, real, vector, mod vector,
// colour, emitter, texture, bool or an asset id), and each element in it must
// be one retail has for that type, with retail's arguments. Remastered's
// re-encodings are undone on the way (docs/REMASTERED_EFFECTS.md):
//
// - LTM2 is written as LTME, one frame shorter; LFOT and LTYP enum bytes go
//   back down by one.
// - MPCB around a vector is stripped; its angle form (MPAC) and ANCR with an
//   unrotated cone become retail's ANGC. MPRD becomes RAND.
// - ROTA is negated back.
// - TEXR's `CNST(id), NONE` becomes retail's `CNST(CNST id)`, and an MTIN
//   material stands in for a missing TEXR through its texture.
// - Ids become 32-bit retail ids through ConvertIO.
// - ASPR becomes ASPH; a cone or sphere turned about X (REUL) becomes an X
//   bias; RNDV becomes a whole-sphere ANGC; a GRAD gradient becomes 101
//   percent keyframes (KEYP) over the particle's life.
// - DFCP/DFCS (a ramp of the depth from the camera) are written as the port's own
//   real elements of the same fourccs (CREDistanceFromCameraBlend).
// - Keyframe blocks and words are byte-swapped; a colour's half keys are
//   widened to floats.
// - Port-only (build/fx-port-contract.md): a TEXR or TIND of TXP2 (an atlas with a
//   random tile) or TXFB (an array texture played over the particle's life, with
//   an optional random mirror in its TRST) or ATX2 (an atlas played over the
//   particle's life) becomes PATL; a PMDL of SLCT(IRND, ARRY
//   of ids) becomes the first model as PMDL and all of them as PMDV.
// - Port-only (build/mpr/vfx/DESIGN.md): an MTIN whose MATI shader has a recipe
//   (RECIPES.md) also writes VMAT (the shader's features, textures and uniform
//   sources), VTMT (TMTR's UV transforms), VPMT (PMTR) and VSMT (SMTR's CCH0
//   uniforms), SSZE, VORN (ORNT), ITEN and SCTR (as VMAT's sprite centre). A
//   shader with no recipe writes none and is listed in `approximated`.
// - Port-only (build/mpr/vfx/RESOLVED-xfmd.md): XFMD 3 and 4 (particles that
//   follow the emitter) are written as they are; SMVR is read only as XFMD 4's
//   mover.
//
// A property that does not convert (a Remastered-only property, an element
// retail does not have, an id with no retail id) is left out and listed in
// `dropped`, so the caller can decide whether the effect is still worth
// writing. Retail fills a left-out property with its default.
//
// Embedded children come out as files of their own, under the ids ConvertIO
// gives their child ids: generators (GPSM) as PART, swooshes (SWSH) as SWHC
// (CParticleSwooshDataFactory's SWSH stream, Remastered's SBDM blend mode as
// AALP) and electric effects (ELC2, ELSM) as ELSC (CParticleElectricDataFactory's
// ELSM stream). ELC2 has no line widths or colours (LWD1-3, LCL1-3), so one
// draws only its child generators and swoosh. The other embedded forms (weapon,
// collision, decal) and KSSM spawn tables are not converted yet.
