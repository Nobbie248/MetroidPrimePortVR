// Writes a Metroid Prime Remastered world's room environments, one
// "<MREA id>.roomenv" per GameCube area (the format is read by port_room_env.h):
// each room's reflection probes with their HDR cubes, the world's tonemap, and
// the room's baked ambient grid (its LTPB), cropped to the room.
//
// Remastered's rooms are not the GameCube's areas. A world's master pak says
// where it puts each room (the RoomController components of its own ROOM), and
// the retail MLVL says where each area sits; Remastered moved the whole world's
// origin, so the shift that lands the most rooms on areas is found first. A room
// is then matched to the area at its place, using the doors (DoorMP1 against the
// area's door objects) to choose among areas that share an origin and as a check.
//
// Nothing here knows where bytes come from or go to, as with ConvertIO in
// port_remastered_convert.h: the retail resources come through RoomIO, the
// Remastered ones from the paks the caller opened.
