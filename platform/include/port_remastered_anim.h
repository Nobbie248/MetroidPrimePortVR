// Reader for the skeletal animations in a Metroid Prime Remastered character (CHPR)
// file. A port of build/mpr/anim/chpr_anim.py and chpr_skel.py (the notes next to them
// say how the format was found). It has no game or GX dependencies.
//
// A CHPR holds a pool of names, one compressed animation blob per animation
// (CAnimCompStream in the exe) and a reference to the skinned model (SMDL) it moves.
// Only the stream layouts the Python decoder knows are supported: rotation tracks (type 0)
// and vec3 tracks (types 1 and 2, linear) for rotation, translation and scale, with
// constant-pool values where an op names no track, in a single stream info. Anything else
// makes ReadCharacter fail with a message rather than guess.
//
// The skeleton (bones, their bind pose, the skin palette) is read from the same file.
// SkinPose combines it with an animation into the matrices a skinned model's joints use.
