#pragma once

// The stereo (headset) state of one recorded frame.
//
// Record once, replay per eye: the game draws its frame once, into the EFB,
// through the normal recording path. When the frame's stereo packet is an
// immersive one, every EFB render pass is also encoded twice more, into a left
// and a right eye target, from the same recorded commands. A GX draw in an eye
// pass binds an eye copy of its uniform (gfx/stereo_uniform.hpp) staged when
// the mono uniform was built, with the eye's frustum and pose composed in; a
// 2D (orthographic) draw binds its mono uniform and so lands identically in
// both eyes; a draw routed AURORA_STEREO_ROUTE_SKIP is left out of the eyes;
// a draw routed AURORA_STEREO_ROUTE_SKY takes the eye's rotation only.
//
// The packet is consumed at frame begin (stereo_host::begin_frame), on the
// game thread, so the eye parameters are fixed before the first uniform is
// staged. The recorder keeps a copy in the FramePacket; the frame worker reads
// that copy, never the host's globals.
