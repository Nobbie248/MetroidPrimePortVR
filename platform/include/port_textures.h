// Device-aware HD texture replacements.
//
// Replacements live in the folder given by MP_TEXTURES (or `textures` next to
// the executable), in Aurora's naming convention. Inside it an optional
// per-device subfolder is selected from the input the player last used
// (PortPrompts::ActiveDevice): xbox, playstation, switch, gamecube or standard
// for a pad, keyboard for a keyboard and mouse or when no pad is connected. The
// subfolder is used when it exists, otherwise the root is used, so a single
// device-agnostic pack keeps working. MP_TEXTURE_DEVICE overrides the name. The
// set is reloaded when the active device changes.
//
// A user pack (MP_USER_TEXTURES, else `user_textures` in the user folder) is
// layered over that built-in set, with the same device-folder rules. Nothing
// the app does on update touches it. On Android it is filled by the overlay's
// folder picker, which copies the chosen folder to `<user root>.new`; the swap
// into place happens on the main thread (or at the next start).
//
// Texture dumping (for authoring replacements) is enabled with
// MP_DUMP_TEXTURES; dumps land in <cachePath>/texture_dumps.
